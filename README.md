# Companion Code for C++ for Fun and Profit

This is the companion code for "C++ for Fun and Profit," a talk given by me to the US Military Academy at West Point.

You can find the video on YouTube here: [https://youtu.be/_HB7_SzkIQ4](https://youtu.be/_HB7_SzkIQ4).

# Building the examples

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

Depending on your environment, you'll find make/Visual Studio/etc. files in
the `build` directory that you can use to compile and execute the demos.
